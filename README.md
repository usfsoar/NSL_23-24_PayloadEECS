## For new members
Hello and welcome to SOAR's Payload EECS repository. 

Please feel free to take on any issue on the [issues tab](/issues).

If you want to contribute first Download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and set it up to your github account. 

After that there are currently 2 approaches for contributions:
1. ***Forking our repo***: This is the easiest way to get started, no permissions required. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/uhwIgnRaXew)

2. ***Creating a branch as a member***: This way requires you to be added to one of our teams, so if you're not sure aobut staying long term I'd suggest starting with *forking*, but if you're commited to helping us out here is what you can do:
> 1. Ask one of the leads to add you to a team as a contributor
> 2. Accept the team invitation in your email
> 3. Follow [this video](https://youtu.be/tXrt2rXsAjA) on how to make contributions as a team member
<!-- > 3. Open Github Desktop then click on `File > Clone Repository` Then switcht to the tab `URL` and paste our repo link: `https://github.com/usfsoar/NSL_23-24_PayloadEECS`
> 4. Once cloned and in your computer you are ready for your first contribution
> 5. Pick an issue from the [issues tab](/issues) and assign yourself to it
> 6. On Github desktop toolbar click on `Branch > New Branch`. Name the branch as something related to the issue you will be taking, I'd suggest `issue/47-fixing-bluetooth` for example
> 7. Modify the code as you see fit to solve the issue you chose.
> 8. Once your code is ready commit, push and publish your branch,and then head over to the [Pull Requests tab](/pulls)
> 9. Create a pull request and make sure to specify your branch as the `compare`
> 10. Write a short description on the changes you did and if you want add @L42ARO as a reviewer
> 11. Create the pull request and if the changes don't break anything it should be added -->

Either approach you take, you're gaining some valuable `git` skills, furthermore you can make as much mistakes as needed, it's part of learning! And you won't have to fear "breaking something important".

### Some tips on picking up Issues
- Any issue with the label `Good First Issue` is probably an easy issue to start with and it might have a guided solution to follow
- Some issues may say **Blocked by** and then list another issue, this just means you most likely need to solve that other issue first or wait for someone else to solve it before proceeding
- Issues should be labeled with the programming language required so you can pick and choose what you're most comfortable

## Keeping up to date your branch/fork
We are constantly making changes to our repo so don't worry if you ever feel behind, that's usual. To keep up to date your code, perform the following:
1. If you're not on a fork, checkout to the branch `main` and pull the latest changes. Then checkout back to your branch.
2. On Github Desktop click on `Branch > Rebase Current Branch`
3. If you're on a fork select `upstream/main`, else select `main`
4. Proceed with the rebase and hopefully by the end of it you should see on the push button the word `force push`
5. Force push your changes to your branch
6. **IF** rebasing doesn't work then attempt to merge to either `upstream/main` if on fork or just `main` if not on fork
> Merging creates a messier git commit history but there are times it's the only option
